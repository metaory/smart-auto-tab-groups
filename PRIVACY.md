# Privacy Policy — Smart Tab Groups

**Last updated:** 2025

## Summary

Smart Tab Groups does not collect, store on our servers, or share any personal data. All processing stays in your browser.

## Data handling

- **Your settings** (e.g. Automatic on/off, group by subdomain) are stored only in your browser using Chrome’s built-in storage. They are not sent to us or any third party. If you use Chrome sync, those settings may sync across your signed-in Chrome devices under Google’s sync policy; we do not receive them.
- **Tab and group operations** (URLs, grouping, collapsing) are used only locally to provide the extension’s features. No tab data or browsing history is sent to our servers or anyone else.
- **No analytics, no telemetry, no account.** We do not track you or collect usage data.
